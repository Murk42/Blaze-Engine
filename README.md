# Blaze-Engine
Blaze-Engine is a c++ game engine written for making it easer to program and implement applications in c++.
It's main goal is to be as efficient and flexible as possible and to let the user have all of the control over the program while still having the platform dependent stuff hidden from the user so they dont have to worry about that.

To use the Blaze-Engine you just need to put ```#include <BlazeEngine/BlazeEngine.h>``` wherever you're using it.

Contact the developer if you have any questions or you're intrested in anything. :)

**Blaze_Engine is still under development and many things change very fast, this readme might not even be up-to-date.**
